 Program #3: Detecting Trends and Foul Language in Twitter
 COSC 1306, Fall 2017
 This program compares different text files for foul language and returns tweets with
 potentially offensive language; and also returns hashtags and the number of times they were used in text file of tweets.
 This could be potentially useful for mass data storage and detecting certain keywords related to bullying, abuse, or other kinds of mistreat.
 Upon tweaking of this algorithm, it could also be relevant to mass data search for a simple search engine.
