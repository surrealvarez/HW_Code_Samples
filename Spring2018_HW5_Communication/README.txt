THIS PROJECT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO PRACTICE ON CLIENT/SERVER RELATIONSHIPS, AS WELL AS ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION SERVERS.

THIS PROGRAM ACCEPTS RESPONSES 'y' or 'n', depending whether the user wants to establish a connection with the first and second client
afterwards, it proceeds to ask on what kind of server it wants the connection.

THAT IS, (ENCRYPTED OR NONENCRYPTED)

AFTERWARDS, THERE EXISTS A DECRYPTION AND ENCRYPTION KEY, (THIS CAN BE MODIFIED IN THE PROGRAM)
which will be utilized on the server, and the user will determine what client receives the key and which doesnt
afterwards, after user input, 

Depending on the criteria chosen by the user , the output (conversation) will be outputted to a file "out.txt"
